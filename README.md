# FlexyBoots - A Flexible Bootstrapped Data Infrastructure

The goal of this repo is to provide a rapidly deployable cloud infastructure which can be adapted to serve varying business needs. By default, the infrastructure provides:
-  ETL / ELT Pipeline Scripts
-  ETL / ELT Pipeline Orchestration (Airflow / Composer)
-  VM-hosted Data Integration Platform (Airbyte)
-  VM-hosted Data Visualisation / BI Platform (Metabase)
-  Data-warehousing functionality (BigQuery)
-  Data Lineage & Quality Monitoring (Amundsen / Great Expectations)

 This is all implemented using Terraform infrastructure as code (IaC), allowing for zero to one improvements to your data architecture within 30 minutes.
